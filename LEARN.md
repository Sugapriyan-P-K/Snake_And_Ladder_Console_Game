# Learn Snake and Ladder Console Game in Java

## Overview

In this guide, we will walk through the process of creating a simple console-based Snake and Ladder game in Java. The game will involve a board, dice rolls, and the movement of players through the board based on the outcome of the dice.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java.

## Steps

### 1. Set Up the Project

- Create a new Java project in your IDE.
- Set up the basic project structure, including the main class.

### 2. Design the Board

- Create a class to represent the game board.
- Initialize the board with the necessary parameters, such as the number of squares.

### 3. Implement the Player

- Create a class to represent a player.
- Include attributes like the player's current position on the board.

### 4. Design the Dice

- Implement a class for the dice that can generate random numbers between 1 and 6.

### 5. Implement Snake and Ladder

- Design classes to represent snakes and ladders on the board.
- Define the start and end positions for each snake and ladder.

### 6. Implement Game Logic

- Write the main game loop that handles player turns.
- In each turn, roll the dice, move the player, and check for snakes and ladders.

### 7. Handle Win Conditions

- Implement the logic to check if a player has reached the final square and won the game.

### 8. Test the Game

- Test the game by running it in the console.
- Ensure that players move correctly, and snakes and ladders affect their positions.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have successfully created a basic Snake and Ladder console game in Java. This project can be expanded further to include more features and improvements.

Feel free to explore additional concepts such as object-oriented principles, error handling, and user input validation as you continue to develop your Java programming skills.
